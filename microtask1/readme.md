For creating new index, i made change to enriched/git.py file and rebuilt the grimoire-elk package for required change.

However, trying to predict countries with timezone doesn't have much potential, unless we have a supplementary information to narrow down the list of countries that exist for a UTC offset, and adding to complexity we have DSt changes.
using files and directories, I tried to create a set of visualization depicting files that are changed frquently with commits during a time period.

here in this directory, I have cloned the grimoire elk repo.
